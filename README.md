# NeuroFlex

## Overview: 

This is a research project I'm working on which proposes an innovative framework for 
neuro-fuzzy systems, specifically designed to address the stability-plasticity dilemma. By integrating Long Short-Term Memory memory cells into the core of neuro fuzzy architecutres, we can achieve a system that is capable of learning and adapting to new information, while still maintaining a stable knowledge base. The framework introduces a dynamic artificial neurogenesis mechanism, which allows the system to grow and prune its knowledge base as needed.

## Roadmap:

- [x] Implement a basic neuro-fuzzy system
- [ ] Implement a neuro-fuzzy system with LSTM memory cells
- [ ] Implement a neuro-fuzzy system with dynamic artificial neurogenesis
- [ ] Implement a neuro-fuzzy system with both LSTM memory cells and dynamic artificial neurogenesis
- [ ] Implement a neuro-fuzzy system with both LSTM memory cells and dynamic artificial neurogenesis, and test it on a real-world dataset
- [ ] Write a paper on the results

## Dataset:

I'm planning to use time series data for testing the system. I'm currently looking for a suitable dataset.

## Dependencies:

I will be implementing the system in Python and julia (if possible) using the following libraries:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scikit-fuzzy](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
